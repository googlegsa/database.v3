Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for databases

The Google Search Appliance connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems.
An enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

The Google Search Appliance Connector for databases
enables the appliance to traverse databases and
index rows in the form of documents.

The Google Search Appliance Connector for databases
communicates with the databases using the ibatis library which is
built on top of the jdbc. So the connector could work with any database
which supports jdbc.
