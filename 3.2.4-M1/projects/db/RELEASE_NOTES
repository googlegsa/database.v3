Release 3.2.0, October 25, 2013
===============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality, reliability, and
performance without adding any new functionality. All users of
previous releases should upgrade to this release.

New Issues in 3.2.0
-------------------
11519723 - Null BLOB or CLOB field values throw a NullPointerException.
           Workaround: Use a CASE or COALESCE expression in the select
           list to avoid NULL values in the BLOB or CLOB field. For
           example, if the field name is "content", use the following
           expressions in the select list instead:

           Oracle BLOB: coalesce(content, empty_blob()) as content
           Oracle CLOB: coalesce(content, empty_clob()) as content
           SQL Server:  coalesce(content, '') as content

           The column alias value is arbitrary, but must match the
           configured BLOB or CLOB Field value.

Issues fixed since 3.0.0
------------------------
11377648 - The configuration form has been rearranged, some fields
           relabeled for clarity, and the radio buttons controlling
           the source of the document content (previously labeled
           "External Metadata Indexing") have been revamped, with a
           fourth radio button to control the use of the stylesheet
           (previously implied), and to mark required fields.

11376925 - Subclasses of DBConnectorType cannot use their own password
           fields. Additional password fields are not masked.

11341445 - [Connector Manager] A diffing connector could get into a
           loop deleting all of the snapshot files on each pass, and
           therefore feeding everything to the GSA for indexing on
           each pass. At least the two most recent snapshot files are
           now saved.

11293325 - The Authorization SQL Query field should always be enabled.

11123956 - Instantiation fails when database configuration properties
           contain special XML characters.

10846134 - Radio buttons are not displayed well in External Metadata
           Indexing section. This section has also been renamed
           Document Content.

10598470 - Column name is case sensitive in the BLOB or CLOB Field.

10117134 - Spaces in the configured primary key are valid but fail at
           runtime.

10097235 - Error message text is displayed twice for missing fields.

9686515 - Fields enabled by the radio buttons cannot be edited with
          Google Search Appliance 7.2.

8489462 - Connector does not close connections on successful crawl and
          connector restart.

8489325 - SQL exception causes connector to delete all documents.

8207127 - Reduce the memory footprint of DocumentHandle serialization.

8161341 - Docid ordering problem with case and accents.

8053932 - Use uncompressed content with metadata-only content feeds
          for better performance with Google Search Appliance 6.14 and
          earlier.

7928861 - [Connector Manager] Avoid unordered snapshots in the
          snapshot files. The diffing package fundamentally requires
          ordered docids. For certain scenarios, this change will lead
          to some documents being repeatedly treated as new documents.
          Previously, some existing documents could be deleted from
          the GSA index and never reindexed.

7732455 - The Base64-encoded docids do not preserve order.

7301553 - When recovering from feed errors, BLOB or CLOB fields are
          missing and the last modified date is misformatted. This
          change also removed the google:displayurl property from
          metadata-and-URL feeds, and uses a configured BLOB or CLOB
          Field even when it not a LOB type.

7301552 - Reduce the size of the DB connector snapshot files.

7301515 - Reduce the memory footprint of LOBs in iBATIS.

7124264 - Log the primary key values for authorization results.
          Previously only the Base64-encoded values were logged.

5102212 - The Connector Hostname field was used only for the
          dbconnector display URLs, and has been replaced by the
          connector instance name.

4529311 - SQL query validation fails with MetaMatrix JDBC driver due
          to an incorrect use of transactions.

4236197 - The Database Name field was used only for the dbconnector
          display URLs, the result XML, and the stylesheet. It has
          been replaced by the connector instance name. Custom
          stylesheets will need to be updated accordingly.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created with versions earlier than 2.8.0 will not
work with this version. Connector Manager version earlier than 3.2.2
will not work correctly with this version of the connector.

Java SE 5.0 is no longer supported. Java 6 or later is required.

This version of the Connector includes an upgrade of its third party
SQL Mapping Framework from iBatis v2.3.0 to MyBatis v3.1.1.
As a result of the upgrade, the syntax for parameter substitutions in
SQL queries changed slightly.  Specifically, the value substitution in
the Parameterized SQL Query changes from "#value#" to "#{value}";
and the docids substitution in the Authorization Query changes from
"$docids$" to "${docids}".

For more information regarding the iBatis to MyBatis migration see:
http://ibatis.apache.org
http://code.google.com/p/mybatis

The result XML element names have changed, so custom stylesheets will
need to be updated to replace references to the configured Database
Name with the connector instance name.

Upgrade Instructions
--------------------
Due to the SQL and XML syntax changes, users should follow these
additional steps when upgrading the connector:

  1) Before upgrading, stop the connector's traversal of the database by
     selecting Disable Traversal on the Connector's configuration page.

  2) Shut down Tomcat.

  3) Upgrade the connector.  If manually upgrading, you MUST remove the
     older iBatis jar file from the installation.  Delete the file
     ${TOMCAT}/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib/ibatis-2.3.0-677.jar
     (where ${TOMCAT} represents the Apache Tomcat directory in your
     connector installation directory).  You SHOULD also remove these
     other third party jars which are no longer used: commons-codec-1.4.jar,
     joda-time.jar, log4j-1.2.9.jar.

  4) Restart Tomcat.

  5) Go to the Connector's configuration page. 

     a) Modify the parameter substitutions if needed. In the Traversal
        SQL Query, change #value# to #{value}. In the Authorization
        SQL Query, change $docids$ to ${docids}. 

     b) Edit the stylesheet if it is enabled. Change references to the
        previously configured Database Name to the connector instance
        name.

     c) Re-enable connector traversal and save the configuration.
